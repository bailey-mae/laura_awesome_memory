## Instructions

To play the memory match game select a card, then select another card to see if you can make a match. If a match is made, the card faces will remain visible until the game is complete or reset. If a match is not made cards will return to starting. Try again until all cards are matched. A timer, star rating and move counter allow you to track your progress throughout the game. At any time you may reset the game using the refresh button on the top right or your web browser's refresh option. A congratulations window will let you know when you have won the game by matching all cards. This window will display stats for the game. Click the play again button to begin a new game.
